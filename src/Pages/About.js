  <h3>Our Idea</h3>
 <p>Our idea is to gather famous and successful tour organizing companies of Pakistan on a 
single platform, so a person does not need to visit each company’s site to find his/her 
dream tour. He/she will search different companies and their tour information on a single 
platform. Then he can easily find for the most suitable tour according to his/her need in 
efficient manner and less time. </p>
 <p>As Pakistan is a developing country. So, tourism can play an important role in its 
economy. This platform can help everyone to travel different place and it will also be a
great help for country. Having all well-known tour companies on a single platform can 
help user to book his tour in an efficient and decent manner rather than visiting different 
sites. It seems more exhausted and hectic for user to find best suitable company and their 
different pages on different social media platform. </p>

<p>Foreigners and our own citizen can use this site for booking their tours with the best 
options. This idea can be useful to lift our tourism which will have great impact on our 
economy. Moreover, as number of companies will be registered and will be providing 
their services which will result in a healthy competition. These companies will try to win 
this competition by providing best and cheap services. They can target more people and 
stand up in competition which will somehow benefit for a user. It can also be helpful for 
government to know about construction and safety issues. Government can see the trend 
of people visiting the spots most so they can develop these spots more to lift more 
tourism there.</p>
<p>Number of tours organizing companies are running in Pakistan some of them are having 
their sites and some are using Facebook and Instagram pages. A user when decides to go 
on tour he has some dates, budget and a venue in his/her mind. By keeping all this in
mind user can starts his search and visit these companies’ sites or social media pages one 
after one for a tour suitable for him. Its very much time consuming as well as tiring. So, 
our idea will give him a platform where all these companies will be giving their tour’s 
plan, he can view all of them at a single place in decent time and decide upon his needs.
As a team of developers, we decided to overcome this problem. We would like to develop 
a site where all tour organizing company can register itself and provide its services. So, a 
user can come to our site and see all plans provided by different companies, check their 
previous trip’s ratings, decide according to his needs and book a tour from a single 
platform. It seems easy for user to book tour in sense of time and money rather than 
wasting hours in visiting all sites and pages and looking for a reasonable tour plan.
</p>
<h3>Our Objective</h3>
<p>To provide user a single platform to pick and book his/her vacation journey so he/she do 
not need to visit all famous tourism companies site for a tour suitable for him/her. It will 
save his/her time moreover he can explore many options so he/she can select one which he 
likes. </p>
